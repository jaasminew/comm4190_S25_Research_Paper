# COMM4190 Spring 2025 - Research Project

### Overview

This project explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the field of marketing. While marketing applications of LLMs span a wide range of areas—including targeting, personalization, content generation, and ad optimization—this paper focuses specifically on personalization and content creation. These two areas are particularly well-suited to LLMs, as they rely on the models' generative and creative strengths to produce tailored marketing content based on detailed consumer profiles.

The study begins with a literature review to assess the current state of research and practice. Building on this foundation, I conducted multiple rounds of testing using a variety of LLMs to evaluate their effectiveness across different marketing scenarios. The goal is to derive insights into the present capabilities and limitations of LLMs in AI-driven marketing, and to identify practical ways they can support business needs more effectively.
